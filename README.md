# compiler-sourcing-framework

A structured, repeatable system for identifying high‑signal compiler engineers across MLIR, LLVM, TVM, Triton, and XLA.  
Designed to support deep‑tech hiring at Fractile AI.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This framework helps identify, evaluate, and engage compiler engineers with strong OSS contributions, deep systems knowledge, and experience across modern compiler stacks.

It is built around:
- Open‑source ecosystems  
- Technical signal patterns  
- Talent mapping  
- Structured outreach  
- Repeatable sourcing workflows

## 🧠 What “High‑Signal” Looks Like in Compiler Engineering
### OSS Contributions
- MLIR (dialects, lowering, bufferization, GPU backend)
- LLVM (passes, IR, codegen)
- TVM (Relay, TIR, MetaSchedule)
- Triton (GPU kernels, scheduling, lowering)
- XLA (HLO, GPU backend)

### Technical Depth Indicators
- IR design and transformations  
- GPU code generation  
- Scheduling and optimization  
- C++ or Rust proficiency  
- Hardware–software co‑design intuition  

### Contribution Patterns
- Merged PRs in relevant repos  
- Multi‑file, non‑trivial changes  
- Active code reviews  
- Issue triage and design discussions

## 🔍 Where I Source Compiler Talent
### Open‑Source Ecosystems
- MLIR  
- LLVM  
- TVM  
- Triton  
- XLA  
- IREE  
- Linux Kernel (for systems‑adjacent candidates)

### High‑Yield Signals
- Recent contributions (last 6–12 months)
- Ownership of dialects, passes, or kernels
- Involvement in design docs or RFCs
- Cross‑stack experience (compiler + runtime)

## 🗺 Talent Mapping (UK & Europe)
This framework includes ongoing mapping of:
- Universities with strong PL/compilers research  
- OSS contributors based in UK/EU  
- Companies producing high‑signal compiler engineers  
- Niche communities (PL, HPC, GPU, Rust, LLVM dev rooms)

---

## 📨 Outreach Philosophy
My outreach is:
- Personalised  
- OSS‑aligned  
- Respectful of engineering craft  
- Focused on technical signal, not job titles  

Example themes:
- Referencing specific PRs or dialects  
- Highlighting alignment with Fractile’s compiler roadmap  
- Acknowledging the complexity of their work  

---

## 🔁 Sourcing Workflow
1. Identify high‑signal repos (MLIR, LLVM, TVM, Triton, XLA)  
2. Review contributors and PR history  
3. Map candidates to UK/EU talent pools  
4. Validate technical depth through OSS patterns  
5. Craft personalised outreach referencing their work  
6. Build long‑term relationships with contributors  

---

## 🧩 Why This Framework Exists
Compiler engineering is a niche, high‑signal domain.  
This framework ensures sourcing is:
- Consistent  
- Evidence‑based  
- Technically grounded  
- Scalable  
- Engineer‑friendly  

It supports Fractile’s mission to build world‑class compiler and runtime teams.
